# 42 C++ Modules (CPP01–CPP09)

This repository contains all the C++ modules from the 42 curriculum.
Each module focuses on learning key concepts of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.

Each module is divided into several **independent exercises** (`ex00`, `ex01`, etc.).  
Every exercise can be **compiled individually** using its own `Makefile`.

### Example
```bash
cd cpp_09/ex00
make
./btc input.txt
```

## Modules Overview
- **CPP01** — Basics: stack vs heap, pointers & references, simple classes, and file I/O.
- **CPP02** — Ad-hoc polymorphism & class design: operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical Form (Rule of Three).
- **CPP03** — Inheritance: base/derived classes, method overriding, and proper ctor/dtor chains.
- **CPP04** — Subtype polymorphism: virtual methods, abstract classes, interfaces, and deep copies.
- **CPP05** — Exceptions: error handling with `try/catch`, custom exceptions.
- **CPP06** — Type casts: `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, `const_cast`, and safe downcasting.
- **CPP07** — Templates: function/class templates.
- **CPP08** — STL & iterators: containers, iterators, algorithms, and custom iterable types.
- **CPP09** — Algorithms with STL: parsing + problem-solving (BitcoinExchange, RPN, PmergeMe).
